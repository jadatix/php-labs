    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Welcome to our Plant Shop, where we offer a wide range of indoor and outdoor plants to suit your needs. Our team of creators, Andrii, Viktoria, and Ivan, are passionate about bringing nature into people's lives and creating a more sustainable future.
At our shop, we believe that caring for plants is not just a hobby, but a responsibility that we all share. Plants are an essential part of our ecosystem, playing a vital role in purifying the air we breathe and regulating the climate. They provide food and shelter for countless species, including humans, and their beauty and therapeutic benefits enhance our well-being.</p>
